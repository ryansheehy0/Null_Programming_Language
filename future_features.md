# Future Features
At the moment this language is very similar to the very first programming languages. They weren't a completely different language, but they instead provided tools to allow programming in assembly to be easier. People still needed to think in asssembly to use the "language". Over time, more and more features got added until the "language" became an actual language where people would think in that language rather than in assembly.

As the early programming languages gave tools for assembly programming so to does this language give tools for C programming. Maybe eventually there will be enough features added to this "language" to make it an actual new language.

These are possible future features to make that a reality.

- Folder/.../file
- Garbage collection
    - Prevent casting to pointers and keep track of references to memory
- Remove unnecessary keywords in C
    - ++ and --
- BNF or regex data type
    - Checks if data matches the BNF or regex during run time
